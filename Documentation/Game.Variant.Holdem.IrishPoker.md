# Game - Community Cards (Hold'em) - Irish Poker

Pineapple hold'em exists halfway between Texas hold'em and Omaha hold'em and has been very popular in Australia and South America, specifically in Medellin, Colombia, where it was first introduced in a private poker room since 2010. Players are initially dealt three cards. Each player then discards one of the three cards (Pre-flop, Post-flop or at Showdown), and the game proceeds exactly as in Texas hold'em.

*Irish Poker:* A variant that transgresses Texas Hold’em and Omaha. Here you get four cards, but you have to get rid of two of them after the betting round on the flop.
