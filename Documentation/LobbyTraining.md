# Lobby Training

The lobby has two modes: ***Training Mode*** and ***Career Mode***. This Section is about ***Training Mode***. The training mode is a mode where the money is given to the player when he enters the table. For example, If the amount is set to 1500 on Table1, every player will receive 1500$ to play with when they will enter the Table.

First, in this mode, you must **identify** yourself. This action puts a unique name to your Tcp Connection for the server. This name will be used as your playername on every table that you will play. For more information, see the [LobbyTraining.Identification](https://github.com/Ericmas001/BluffinMuffin.Protocol/blob/master/C%23/Documentation/LobbyTraining.Identification.md) section.
