Using these DLLs is not a requirement to implement the protocol, but it can save you some time ;)\r\n    \r\n####Known Implementations\r\n * **[BluffinMuffin.Beta](http://ericmas001.github.io/BluffinMuffin.Beta)** *(Protocol v1.0)*\r\n\r\n\r\n####Current Version: **[1.0.1](https://github.com/Ericmas001/BluffinMuffin.Protocol/releases/tag/v1.0.1)** (2015-05-04)\r\n * Readme was improved\r\n * Changelog page added\r\n * Assembly versions has been normalized\r\n * Diagrams were missing or incorrect (#16)\r\n * *[Full changelog ...](https://github.com/Ericmas001/BluffinMuffin.Protocol/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)*\r\n\r\n\r\n=====================================================\r\n=====================================================\r\n\r\n## General Commands\r\nGeneral commands are for communication everywhere.\r\n\r\n * **[DisconnectCommand](https://github.com/Ericmas001/BluffinMuffin.Protocol/blob/master/Documentation/BluffinMuffin.Protocol.DisconnectCommand.md)** \r\n\r\n   This command is sent to inform the other end of the Tcp Connection that the communication should end\r\n\r\n## Lobby Commands\r\nLobby commands are for communication about identification, table list, table creations, etc. Everything that is around a poker game, but that isn't directly a poker game.\r\nThe lobby has two modes: ***Quick mode*** and ***Registered mode***. \r\n\r\n### Quick mode\r\nThe Quick mode is a mode where the money is given to the player when he enters the table.
